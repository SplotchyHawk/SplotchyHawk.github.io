          <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
            My name is Sebastien Godbout, I am 22 years old, and was born in BC Canada.
            I have recently graduated from Western University of Ontario. I completed an
            Honors Specialization in Computer Science and a Minor in Game Development. Using the 
            knowledge I have gained through my education, I have created this website using visual
            studios. My goal is to show my coding capabilities, personality, and determination to future
            employers. I wish to hone my skills into a certain subject instead of having a wide
            variety of knowledge about the software development industry. I am an attentive, ambitious,
            and resourcful individual seeking to create lasting business relationships. I hope to
            solidify these connections with the skills I have aquired from my education and individual
            experience. Python is one of my earliest languages. It acted as my introduction to my bachelors
            degree. As I progressed through classes, they adobted more indepth languages such as Java,
            C++, and C. These were the most popular languages throughout my education. I created anything
            from TikTakTo games against AI, to data management algorithms made to simplify and organise
            output from external API. I also delved into SQL databases where I managed customers, vehicles,
            and IDs pertaining to different available bus trips. This incorporated HTML, PHP, and
            CSS in order to create an interface that allows users to add themselves to the SQL databases
            and book or cancel trips. On top of this, my gaming minor made me work with C# within Unity.
            You can find some of my personal videogames and thier game mechanic descriptions in the Gaming 
            section of the website. On top of this wide variety of education, I have a sports background
            that stems from a young age. This includes soccer, rugby, and taekwondo, which are explored
            more within the sports section of my website.
