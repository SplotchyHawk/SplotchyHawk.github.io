          <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                I have been an avid soccer player since the age of five. For my 
                youth years I played mostly in the Metro league, beginning with Vancouver’s team and then 
                to Burnaby with an increasing amount of success as time went on. In 2016 I won gold 
                at the youth provincial A cup with the 1999 Burnaby district metro select squad. Then 
                in 2018 went on to win bronze with the 2000 squad of the same league. I also won gold 
                at the Surrey mayor’s cup with the same 2000 squad that same season. Throughout 
                these years I always excelled in speed and endurance. I then decided to go to Western 
                University of Ontario where I tried out for their varsity team. Out of approximately 
                100 people I was one of 7 asked to continue playing and 
                practicing with the team. Unfortunately, about two weeks into consistent practices and 
                fitness we were informed that the roster was full. 
                <br><br>
                I did my bachelor's in computer science with a minor in game development and because of the heavy course 
                load decided to take a break from high intensity soccer for second year and played indoor and outdoor leagues.
                Third and fourth year soccer was disrupted by Covid but I played competitively during summers in Vancouver
                where Covid regulations were less strict.
                <br><br> 
                I was referred to a New Westminister summer team where I dominated and helped them to a 
                league victory with an average of 2 goals per game. I needed more competitiveness and 
                therefore, after graduating from university in June of 2022, tried out for Juve FC in 
                BMSL Div 1 which is where I have been playing for the past year. I am currently their top 
                goal scorer. I excel in speed intensive positions like striker or winger. I gravitate 
                towards striker as I can conserve more energy to give my all on runs, finish 
                consistently, and be that outlet up top.
