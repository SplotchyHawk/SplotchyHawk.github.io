          <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                I have been an avid soccer player for my whole life. 
                My background consists of many years of soccer which started at the age of 5. For my 
                youth years I played mostly in the metro league. I played on Vancouver’s team and then 
                Burnaby's team with an increasing amount of success as I grew older. In 2016 I won gold 
                at the youth provincial A cup with the 1999 Burnaby district metro select squad. Then 
                in 2018 went on to win bronze with the 2000 squad of the same league. I also won gold 
                at the Surrey mayor’s cup with the same 2000 squad either in 2017 or 2018. Throughout 
                these years I always excelled in speed and endurance. I then decided to go to university 
                in Ontario. I attended Western University in London Ontario where I then tried out for 
                their varsity team. Out of 50-100 people I was one of 7 asked to continue trying out and 
                practicing with the team. Unfortunately, about two weeks into consistent practices and 
                fitness with the team I was not chosen to join the already full squad. I did my bachelors
                in computer science with a minor in game development and because of the heavy course 
                load decided to take a break from high intensity soccer for second year as well as covid 
                mixing up my plans to tryout again the following two years. However, throughout 
                university I stayed in shape and kept playing recreationally with indoor and outdoor men 
                leagues. I would also play competitively during the summers when covid would allow it. 
                I was referred to a New Westminister summer team where I dominated and caried them to a 
                league victory with an average of 2 goals per game. I needed more competitiveness and 
                therefore, after graduating from university in June of 2022, tried out for Juve FC in 
                BMSL Div1 which is where I have been playing for the past year. I am currently their top 
                goal scorer by far and know I could be playing at a higher level. What level remains to 
                be seen but I am seeking exposure to hopefully reach higher competitiveness of play. I 
                find myself playing speed intensive roles such as striker or winger but I gravitate 
                towards striker as I can conserve more energy to give my all on runs, finish 
                consistently, and be that outlet up top.
