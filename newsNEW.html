                The website has finally been made public! It is a way
                to showcase my coding skills and give a more in-depth understanding of who I am. This website is made
                with the intention of building relationships with employers and employees who would be interested in
                my background. The website was coded by myself and is hosted using Github, where all the code is public
                to read.
