          <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                First of all,
                at the age of five I took up soccer, baseball, and taekwondo. I gravitated
                towards the endurance and fast pace of the sports which ultimately had me 
                slowly faze out baseball. I went on to get my junior school blackbelt at the
                age of eleven. This is where I stopped martial arts because getting an 
                international was the next logical step bt required me to be sixteen. this
                does not take away from how much it taught me in self control, defense, and 
                respect. The physical activity I did stick with long term is soccer. The sport 
                has allowed me to stay in great shape and acts as an escape from the world's
                trials and tribulations. Furthermore, artistically I have a gift with drawing.
                All throughout French emersion elementary school I would illustrate comic panels 
                that told a story. These stories, however basic with traces of character 
                development, would be what inspired me to follow my current path through through 
                university. With the help of great friends and in turn great grades and study 
                habbits, I excelled in achademics earning the honor role scholarship my school 
                offered to its students. On top of this I earned an equivalent scholarship in 
                the physical education section of the school.<br>
                I have been an avid soccer player for my whole life. 
                My background consists of many years of soccer which started at the age of 5. For my 
                youth years I played mostly in the metro league. I played on Vancouver’s team and then 
                Burnaby's team with an increasing amount of success as I grew older. In 2016 I won gold 
                at the youth provincial A cup with the 1999 Burnaby district metro select squad. Then 
                in 2018 went on to win bronze with the 2000 squad of the same league. I also won gold 
                at the Surrey mayor’s cup with the same 2000 squad either in 2017 or 2018. Throughout 
                these years I always excelled in speed and endurance. I then decided to go to university 
                in Ontario. I attended Western University in London Ontario where I then tried out for 
                their varsity team. Out of 50-100 people I was one of 7 asked to continue trying out and 
                practicing with the team. Unfortunately, about two weeks into consistent practices and 
                fitness with the team I was not chosen to join the already full squad. I did my bachelors
                in computer science with a minor in game development and because of the heavy course 
                load decided to take a break from high intensity soccer for second year as well as covid 
                mixing up my plans to tryout again the following two years. However, throughout 
                university I stayed in shape and kept playing recreationally with indoor and outdoor men 
                leagues. I would also play competitively during the summers when covid would allow it. 
                I was referred to a New Westminister summer team where I dominated and caried them to a 
                league victory with an average of 2 goals per game. I needed more competitiveness and 
                therefore, after graduating from university in June of 2022, tried out for Juve FC in 
                BMSL Div1 which is where I have been playing for the past year. I am currently their top 
                goal scorer by far and know I could be playing at a higher level. What level remains to 
                be seen but I am seeking exposure to hopefully reach higher competitiveness of play. I 
                find myself playing speed intensive roles such as striker or winger but I gravitate 
                towards striker as I can conserve more energy to give my all on runs, finish 
                consistently, and be that outlet up top.
